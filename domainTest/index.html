            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>
                The Domain Fortune Score is a fun tool designed to give you a quick insight into the "fortune" of your chosen domain name. The concept of "fortune" here is based on a simplified numerology system where each character in the domain contributes to an overall score. This score is then interpreted to give a fortune rating ranging from "Good" to "Bad".
            </p>
            <p>
                While the results are meant for entertainment purposes, choosing a good domain name is crucial for your online presence. A memorable and positive-sounding domain can contribute to the success of your website. Feel free to use this tool to experiment with different domain names and see what fortune they might bring!
            </p>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Simply enter your desired domain name in the input field above and click on "Get Fortune Score". The tool will calculate and give out a message based on the domain name and provide a fortune rating. Please note that each attempt to calculate a fortune score will deduct <strong>1 point</strong> from your account. Make sure you have enough points to continue!
